# Doraemon-An-AI-powered-interactive-platform
We all loved cartoons as kids, and this project brings that nostalgia to life. I developed an interactive platform where users can chat directly with Doraemon and explore his gadgets and stories from the cartoon. It combines creativity with technology, making the experience fun and engaging.
This project brings childhood nostalgia to life by letting users interact directly with Doraemon through an engaging platform. It features a chatbot to talk with Doraemon, a list of his gadgets, a section for Doraemon movies, the ability to draw with Doraemon, and even enjoy the Doraemon theme song â€” all in one place.
The project is built using full-stack development, with a clean and interactive frontend in HTML & CSS, and a robust backend in Node.js to manage conversations and content seamlessly. It combines fun, creativity, and technology into a unique experience for all Doraemon fans.
